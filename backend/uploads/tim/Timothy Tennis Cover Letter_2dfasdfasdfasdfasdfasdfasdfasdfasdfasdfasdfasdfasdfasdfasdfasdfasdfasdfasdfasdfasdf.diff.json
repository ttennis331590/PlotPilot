I am an experienced medical writer with over four years of total writing experience, three of which were focused solely on oncology scientific content. As a result, I am confident that I have the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in this position as an experienced Medical Writer with a strong background in medical communications.\n\nDuring my tenure in the US and Worldwide Medical Communications organization at Bristol-Myers Squibb, I developed and oversaw the creation of various oncology scientific content pieces, including study backgrounders, standard response letters, Q&A documents, and core slide decks. In this role, I maintained a large body of work and regularly assessed the content for strategic alignment with the larger organization's goals. To achieve this goal, maintaining open communication with stakeholders across the organization was imperative.\n\n\n\nAs a medical writer in the Global Safety and Regulatory Documentation organization, I led cross-functional teams to create complex clinical documents required for regulatory submissions. I have a strong track record of coordinating and integrating scientific, medical, and regulatory input from development team members, leading teams to define content and organization for complex documents. Unfortunately, due to health issues that have since been resolved, I left this role at the end of November 2022.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\nTimothy Tennis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
