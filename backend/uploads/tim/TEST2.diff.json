He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with the dead.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Are they dead?” Royce asked softly. “What proof have we?”\n\n\n\n“Will saw them,” Gared said. “If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.”\n\n'\n\nWill had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. “My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,” he put in.\n\n\n\n“My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,” Royce replied. “Never believe anything you hear at a woman’s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.” His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest.\n\n\n\n“We have a long ride before us,” Gared pointed out. “Eight days, maybe nine. And night is falling.”’\n\n\n\nSer Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. “It does that every day about this time. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?”\n\n\n\nWill could see the tightness around Gared’s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night’s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.\n\n\n\n"
